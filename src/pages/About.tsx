            I am a developer who has recently been working in web and mobile development, 
            providing me with a solid foundation in both fields of development.
            <br />
            <br />
            
            Currently, I am working as a freelancer developer, 
            primarily catering to clients who are students 
            engaged in their project and thesis applications. 
            Additionally, I undertake projects from startup 
            enterprises.
                        
        </div>
        
        
    );
